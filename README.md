# Chipotle-Sale-Analysis
This is personal project to improving data analysis skills.
I analyzes over 4,000 rows of Chipotleâ€™s sales data to uncover insights into revenue trends, item popularity, and the impact of customizations on sales. The analysis includes SQL-based data cleaning, transformation, and metric calculation, as well as the creation of a dynamic dashboard in Excel to visualize actionable business insights.

## Project Overview

In this project, I conducted an independent analysis of Chipotle's sales data to gain insights into customer spending patterns, top-selling items, and customization trends. The data set includes order IDs, item names, quantities, prices, and choice descriptions. The project involved:

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Removing duplicates and transforming data to ensure accuracy.
- **SQL Querying**: Calculating important business metrics and analyzing trends such as revenue per item, average order value, and top-selling products.
- **Data Analysis in Excel**: Exporting query results to Excel for further analysis and creating a dynamic dashboard.

## Key Metrics & Insights

### 1. **Total Revenue**
   - Calculated the total revenue generated by all sales, providing a snapshot of overall sales performance.

### 2. **Average Order Value (AOV)**
   - Determined the average order value across all transactions to understand customer spending behavior.

### 3. **Top-Selling Items**
   - Analyzed revenue by item to identify the top 5 items contributing the most to total sales.

### 4. **Least Popular Items**
   - Identified the least popular items to highlight potential areas for menu adjustments.

### 5. **Beverages Revenue Analysis**
   - Focused on beverages like sodas, water, and drinks to calculate their revenue percentage in relation to total sales.

### 6. **Item Customization Impact**
   - Examined the impact of customization on revenue by analyzing items with customization options.

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL**: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and querying to calculate key business metrics.
- **Excel**: Exported SQL results to Excel to further analyze the data, create pivot tables, and design a dynamic dashboard with interactive charts, slicers, and filters.
- **GitHub**: Managed the project and shared the analysis through version control.

## Steps Followed

### Data Cleaning & Transformation
1. Removed duplicate rows using `DISTINCT` in SQL to ensure accurate results.
2. Cleaned and transformed data, such as removing the dollar sign from prices and converting them to decimals for calculations.

### SQL Queries & Analysis
1. **Revenue Calculation by Item**: Aggregated revenue by item using SQL's `SUM` function.
2. **Total Revenue Calculation**: Calculated total revenue by multiplying quantity by item price and summing the results.
3. **Top & Least Popular Items**: Identified the most and least popular items by revenue and quantity sold.
4. **Beverage Revenue Analysis**: Focused on beverages (e.g., sodas, water) to analyze their revenue contribution.

### Exporting to Excel & Dashboard Creation
1. Exported SQL results to Excel.
2. Used **pivot tables** and **dynamic charts** to visualize trends and insights.
3. Created a **dynamic dashboard** in Excel with slicers and filters to allow for interactive exploration of the data.

## Results & Business Recommendations
- **Optimize Menu**: Insights into the top and least popular items can guide menu adjustments, helping to prioritize high-selling items.
- **Pricing Strategy**: Understanding the average order value and item revenue can help fine-tune pricing strategies.
- **Customization Impact**: By analyzing customized items, Chipotle can understand customer preferences and optimize their product offerings.
